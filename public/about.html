<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Bianca Malhotra, a 20-year-old undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). My academic journey has been incredibly rewarding and challenging, pushing me to constantly learn and adapt to the rapidly evolving tech landscape. I am currently preparing for interviews to embark on my career as a software developer, a role I am passionate about due to its potential to innovate and solve complex problems. My technical skills are complemented by a strong foundation in AI/ML, which I believe will be invaluable in creating intelligent and efficient software solutions.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I have a deep love for painting, particularly Madhubani painting. This traditional Indian art form has always fascinated me with its intricate patterns and vibrant colors, providing a perfect outlet for my creativity and attention to detail. Painting not only allows me to express myself artistically but also serves as a relaxing counterbalance to the technical rigor of my studies. Additionally, I enjoy dancing, which is another way I express my creativity and maintain a balanced lifestyle.</p>

<p>In addition to my artistic endeavors, I am an avid reader who finds joy in exploring different genres of books. Reading not only broadens my knowledge but also enhances my ability to think critically and creatively. This passion for reading complements my academic pursuits by keeping me well-informed and intellectually stimulated. Combining these interests, I strive to balance my technical skills with a well-rounded personal development, preparing myself for a successful and fulfilling career in software development.</p>
